# embedded-ML
This repository includes materials and guides for a collection of 10 Embedded Machine Learning educational studios and an open-ended lab. There is a lab prompt for both introductory level courses and advanced level courses.

# Studios
**Necessary Materials for Studios:**
1. (2) [TinyML with Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Kits](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-tiny-machine-learning-kit) OR (2) [Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Boards](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano-33-ble-sense) * The kits are preferable since they also come with the Arduino Shield.
2. (1) USB cable (The kits have USB cables. However, if a USB to lightning adapter is necessary, those are not in the kits.)
3. (1) 9V battery
4. (1) [Cables](https://www.amazon.com/Parts-Express-Battery-Clip-Pack/dp/B01IFP0N3U/ref=asc_df_B01IFP0N3U/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198057711065&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1383601955564824598&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9022860&hvtargid=pla-350869377063&psc=1) to connect the battery to Nano GND & VIN pins.
5. (1) [Edge Impulse Account](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/)
6. (1) Computer running MacOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, or Rapsian OS.

**Instructions for Studios:**
1. Complete the studios in order. The studios walk through the steps of designing this lab in order that they should be completed. The concepts in each also build off the previous studios.
2. Submit answers to all questions in a separate document. Make sure to include any files that were requested in the submission.

5. Any materials desired for creating the peripheral device. This may include parts such as a switch and perfboard jumper cables.
6. (1) [Edge Impulse Account](https://www.edgeimpulse.com/)
7. (1) Computer running MacOS, Windows, Linux, Ubuntu, or Rapsian OS.

**Instructions for the Lab:**
1. Follow the prompt given for the lab. This is intended to be a creative project so be creative and explore various aspects of embedded machine learning!
2. If you get stuck, refer to the studios to see if there is guidance on the challenge you are encountering.
